# thefirey33's new website.

This is the website that I made for myself. As a personal portfolio page,
It works for what it does.

The old website used basic Svelte, this one uses SvelteKit and other methods to keep it better and more possible. *and less buggy.*

> # Basic Information
>
> 1. This is a passion-project, plus a demonstration of my programming knowledge. So, data-types might change frequently.
> 2. All the links are stored in JSON files.

>To start a development build of this website, use:
>```sh
>npm run dev
>
># or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
>npm run dev -- --open
>```

> To build a production version of this website, use:
>```sh
>npm run build
>```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy this app, you may need an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
